Material Design, which was introduced by Google in 2014, has quickly become a popular choice for designers looking to create intuitive, user-friendly apps and websites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why is Material Design still a great option for designing apps and websites? Here are a few reasons:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Material Design is intuitive and user-friendly. The design principles behind Material Design are based on the physical properties of real-world objects, such as how light and shadows interact with objects. This creates a familiar and intuitive experience for users, making it easy for them to navigate and interact with your app or website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"542\" src=\"https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\/dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/material-design-image-01-design-system-2022-12-16-103334-1024x542.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/material-design-image-01-design-system-2022-12-16-103334-1024x542.webp 1024w, https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/material-design-image-01-design-system-2022-12-16-103334-300x159.webp 300w, https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/material-design-image-01-design-system-2022-12-16-103334-768x406.webp 768w, https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/material-design-image-01-design-system-2022-12-16-103334.webp 1281w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Material Design is responsive. With the increasing number of devices and screen sizes, it&#8217;s important for your app or website to be responsive and adaptable to different devices. Material Design uses flexible grids and responsive animations, allowing your design to adjust seamlessly to different screen sizes and resolutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Material Design is consistent. Material Design uses a consistent visual language across all platforms and devices, ensuring that your brand and design elements are consistent and recognizable no matter where they are viewed. This creates a cohesive user experience and helps to establish trust and credibility with your users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"720\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\/dev\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/unnamed-2022-12-16-103633.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/unnamed-2022-12-16-103633.png 720w, https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/unnamed-2022-12-16-103633-300x150.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Material Design is versatile. The design principles behind Material Design are flexible and can be applied to a wide variety of designs, from simple, flat designs to more complex, layered designs. This allows designers to create unique and engaging experiences that are tailored to their specific needs and goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, Material Design is still a great option for designing apps and websites because it is intuitive, responsive, consistent, and versatile. Whether you&#8217;re a designer looking to create a new app or website, or a business owner looking to update your existing design, Material Design is a solid choice that will help you create a user-friendly, engaging, and cohesive experience for your users.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google&#8217;s Design System: Material Design As a designer, one of the biggest challenges is staying current with the latest design&#8230; <\/p>\n<div class=\"art-el-more\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\/2024\/03\/07\/meet-material-design-the-design-system-of-google\/\" class=\"art-link art-color-link art-w-chevron\">Read more<\/a><\/div>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":345,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[4],"class_list":["post-14","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-web-design","tag-design"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\//wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/14"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\//wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\//wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\//wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\//wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=14"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\//wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/14\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":17,"href":"https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\//wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/14\/revisions\/17"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\//wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/345"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\//wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=14"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\//wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=14"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gervisbermudez.github.io/site\//wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=14"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
